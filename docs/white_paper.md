A Smart Contract Game About Sheep Farming
===
Many games employ a simple ledger mechanic to track credits and benefits that accrue to the players as they execute turns and undergo events. The ledger mechanic lends itself easily to the blockchain, and the cryptographic security afforded by the blockchain allows games to craft shared objects of value that players can own and trade. Game of Sheep is built around a decentralized ledger. The sheep in the game are tokenized, allowing the game to include tokenomics around NFTs.

Game of Sheep is an homage to the board game Squatter, a game described on Wikipedia as ‚Äúnumber 8 in 14 justifiably forgotten Milton Bradley board games.‚Äù As such, this project and code may only be deployed on testnets and are never allowed to make any commercial profit. As for HBO, ü§î

# Tokenomics

The game centers on selling sheep at a lower price than they are bought. Tokens on a Smart Contract can track the balances of sheep, and a ledger can track the amounts.

The economics of the game is simply a model of the economics of a sheep farm. The decentralized version tokenizes this economy with two tokens: dollars and sheep. Players will maintain a balance between these two tokens, adding or drawing down according to game events or tactical options.

Decentralized Finance features of the game include:

- Decentralized Ledger
- Tezos Smart Contracts
- Token transfers for sheep and dollars
- NFTs that carry entitlements or obligations
- Liquidity Pools
- Staking and Rewards

## Smart Contracts

As the game is a ledger with frills the contracts for handling transfers will be FA.2.

## NFTs
The original board game was designed for six players. Game of Sheep, the Decentralized Version, will be for single-player play. However, there will be interaction among players through competing for NFTs that are of use in the game. For example, any player has access to a fire fighting equipment NFT, since any amount of these may be minted. But there are 5 unique Stud Ram NFTS. When a player with a Stud Ram NFT lands on ‚ÄúStud Ram Dies,‚Äù the NFT is burned.

The Liability and Benefit NFTs are burned when used, generally at Wool Sale, incurring some owed deficit defined by the NFT. Benefits can be stacked.Holding some will help players; holding others may mean a penalty, but they are burned when used in the game, and new ones can be minted when required.

All images used in the game NFTs were created with [stableboost.ai](https://stableboost.ai/images) and edited in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

## Asset NFTs

The NFTs can be burned when needed or they can provide ongoing benefits.

## Liability NFTs

The NFTs are obtained through random events within the game. They will be added to a players account and will generally impose penalties at Wool Sales or Stock Sales. A liability NFT will be bured when the liability is dispensed or its condition resolved.

## Paddock Improvements
Move your sheep through a series of improved pastures. Pay the costs of raising sheep for the market. Make money from selling wool and use it to improve pasture. A player may invest their sheep tokens into one of three 
Liquidity pools:

    - Natural Pasture LP
    - Improve Pasture LP
    - Irrigated Pasture LP

Transfer of sheep from a pool to a more advanced pool carries a fee and can only be conducted under conditions such as no drought, having provided liquidity in the prerequisite pool, and so forth.

When a player has added sheep and dollars to a given Paddock LP they get LP tokens for that pool which can be staked. To go from Natural Pasture to Improved Pasture a player must have enough Natural Pasture LP tokens staked. To move the sheep to the new pasture the Natural Pasture LP tokens are unstaked, the natural pasture LP sheep are removed from the pool and added to the Improved Pasture pool, where they can be staked for Improved Pasture LP tokens.

Players start the game with 3000 sheep, which is also the maximum capacity for the Natural Pasture LP. Improved pasture has a capacity of 5000 sheep and irrigated pasture is 6000.

If the player adds the 3000 initial sheep to the Natural Pasture LP they will get 15 Natural Pasture LP tokens.  These in turn can be added to the Improved pasture LP, given the game conditions at the time allow it, along with $2500, to earn Improved Pasture LP tokens. And similarly to get Irrigated Pasture, but adding $7500.

The staked LP tokens are ultimately the victory condition for the game. A player wins the game when they have staked the LP tokens earned from having 6000 sheep in the Irrigated Pasture LP.

## Stock Sales

At intervals a player will have the opportunity to buy or sell sheep at market. 

## Wool Sales

Once each game cycle a player has the opportunity to gain dollars from a Wool Sale.

## Penalties, Fines, Bonuses and Rewards

Droughts, Plagues, Fires, Rabbits, all sorts of maintenance obligations and various anti-sheep phenomena impact cash flow and balances throughout the game. 

# Mechanics
## Game Cycle
The result of two rolled dice is added, and the player is advanced to the next event. For each mod 43, there is a Wool Sale. The events are various functions affecting the yields at Stock Sales or Wool Sales. Some game tokens and some game obligations will be handled with NFTs. There are asset NFTs and liability NFTs.

### Randomization
To avoid the same sequence of events occurring in each game, the randomizer has to be non-deterministic. There are pseudo-random functions that can be used, but they will repeat. The game will therefore use a smart contract that communicates with a blockchain oracle that produces random numbers.
